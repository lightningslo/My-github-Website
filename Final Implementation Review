• Usability - is your implementation done in a way that a user can navigate and use your
website without any additional instruction? (10 points)
• Educational value - does your implementation effectively teach a user about your topic?
Does this content make sense for the personas you have developed? (25 points)
• Interactivity - does your implementation have interactive elements that enhance the
user experience? (25 points)
• Aesthetics - is your implementation visually appealing? (10 points)
• Document with explanation of how you have met the requirements for the final project.
(10 points)


- For each of the criteria listed above (usability, educational value, interactivity,
and aesthetics), explain how these are present in your implementation. I.e., tell
me why I should give you full credit (or not full credit) for each criterion.

– Is there an aspect of the project that does not fit into the above criteria, but you
put special effort into? (e.g., making your website accessible to screen readers,
making your website work well on a phone, etc.) I may consider giving extra
credit for such work.
